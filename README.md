# My Portfolio Site

This is my website that devleoped in Typescript, React and the Framer Motion animation library

It is based on contemporary "awwward" winning websites
[Visit Awwwards](https://www.awwwards.com/)

#### Features
- Custom mouse cursor with a smooth animation
- Parallax scroll for the header text
- Text animation on hover
- Page load animation
- Fade in text on scroll
- Page colour change on scroll

# Installation
- clone the project
- have node installed on your machine
- npm install 
- npm run dev (It's just a static website with no server)

### Thoughts
- It was a pleasure to build this website as I always wanted to make a website that could move towards the quality of the fancy contemporary sites that you see on Awwwards
- My dream would be to build something that could receive such an accolade
